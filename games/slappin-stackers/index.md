### 👏 Slappin Stackers 👏

*Two-player local multiplayer competitive action game made in 48 hours with five friends.*

For most of us this was our first time making a game in the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine, and we were interested in how easy it would be to learn. We all agreed by the end that it is much easier to learn than other widely-used engines in 2019 and is a worthy choice for game jams, primarily due to its simplicity and speed.
